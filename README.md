### CGCF tracks your Voluum or Everflow campaigns and postbacks within Clickfunnels


![Click Funnels Tracker](http://paulpierre.com/img/cgcf.jpg)

built by [http://paulpierre.com](http://paulpierre.com) in 2018

My partner and I were running several of our branded e-commerce products on a platform called Click Funnels. CF would have simple to use funnels but terrible develop integrations, likle integrating sophisticated tracking 

I created a javascript integration that would allow us to track campaigns in a sophisticated manner with both our tracking tools Everflow and Voluum. I decided to give this away so other devs don't have to suffer :)
